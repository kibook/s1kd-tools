s1kd-upissue - Upissue S1000D data
.SH SYNOPSIS

\f[C]
s1kd-upissue [-045defilmNQqRsuvw\[ha]] [-1 <type>] [-2 <type>]
             [-c <reason> [-H] [-t <urt>]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]s1kd-upissue\f[R] tool increases the in-work or issue number of
an S1000D CSDB object.
.PP
Any files using an S1000D-esque naming convention, placing the issue and
in-work numbers after the first underscore (_) character, can also be
\[dq]upissued\[dq].
Files which do not contain the appropriate S1000D metadata are simply
copied.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-0, --unverified
Set the quality assurance to unverified.
.TP
-1, --first-ver <type>
Set first verification type (tabtop, onobject, ttandoo).
If the object is second verified and this option is specified without -2
(--second-ver), the second verification will be unset.
.TP
-2, --second-ver <type>
Set second verification type (tabtop, onobject, ttandoo).
If the object is unverified and this option is specified without -1
(--first-ver), the first verification will be set as the same type as
the second verification.
.TP
-4, --remove-marks
Remove change markup on elements, but not RFUs, in the upissued object.
This is automatically applied if the issue type (-z) is not
\f[C]\[dq]changed\[dq]\f[R] or \f[C]\[dq]rinstate-changed\[dq]\f[R].
.TP
-5, --print
Print the file names of upissued objects.
.TP
-c, --reason <reason>
Add a reason for update to the upissued objects.
Multiple RFUs can be added by specifying this option multiple times.
.TP
-d, --dry-run
Do not actually create or modify any files.
.TP
-e, --erase
Remove old issue file after upissuing.
.TP
-f, --overwrite
Overwrite existing upissued CSDB objects.
.TP
-H, --highlight
Mark the last specified reason for update (-c) as a highlight.
.TP
-h, -?, --help
Show help/usage message.
.TP
-I, --date <date>
Specify the issue date to use for the upissued object(s).
Otherwise, the current date will be used.
.TP
-i, --official
Increase the issue number of the CSDB object.
By default, the in-work issue is increased.
.TP
-l, --list
Treat input (stdin or arguments) as lists of CSDB objects to upissue,
rather than CSDB objects themselves.
.TP
-m, --modify
Modify issue-related metadata on objects without incrementing the issue
or inwork numbers.
The -I and -r options have the opposite effect in this mode.
The modified objects are written to stdout by default, and the -f option
can be used to change them in-place.
.TP
-N, --omit-issue
Omit issue/inwork numbers from filename.
.TP
-Q, --keep-qa
Keep quality assurance information from old issue.
Normally, when upissuing an official CSDB object to the first in-work
issue, the quality assurance is set back to \[dq]unverified\[dq].
Specify this option to indicate the upissue will not affect the contents
of the CSDB object, and so does not require it to be re-verified.
.TP
-q, --quiet
Quiet mode.
Errors are not printed.
.TP
-R, --keep-unassoc-marks
Delete only change markup on elements associated with an RFU (by use of
the attribute \f[C]reasonForUpdateRefIds\f[R]).
Change markup on other elements is ignored.
.TP
-r, --(keep|remove)-changes
Keep old RFUs and change marks.
Normally, when upissuing an offical CSDB object to the first in-work
issue, any reasons for update are deleted automatically, along with any
change markup attributes on elements (when change type is \[dq]add\[dq]
or \[dq]modify\[dq]) or the elements themselves (when change type is
\[dq]delete\[dq]).
This option prevents their deletion.
.RS
.PP
In -m mode, this option has the opposite effect, causing the current
RFUs and change marks to be removed.
The two alternative long option names, --keep-changes and
--remove-changes, allow for the intended meaning of this option to be
expressed clearly in each mode.
.RE
.TP
-s, --(keep|change)-date
Do not change issue date.
Normally, when upissuing to the next inwork or official issue, the issue
date is changed to the current date, or the date specified with the -z
option.
This option will keep the date of the previous inwork or official issue.
.RS
.PP
In -m mode, this option has the opposite effect, causing the date to be
changed.
The two alternative long option names, --keep-date and --change-date,
allow for the intended meaning of this option to be expressed clearly in
each mode.
.RE
.TP
-t, --type <urt>
Set the updateReasonType of the last specified reason for update (-c).
.TP
-u, --clean-rfus
Remove RFUs which are not associated with any change markup (by use of
the attribute \f[C]reasonForUpdateRefIds\f[R]).
.TP
-v, --verbose
Verbose output.
.TP
-w, --lock
Make the old issue file read-only after upissuing.
Official issues (-i) will also be made read-only when they are created.
.TP
-z, --issue-type <type>
Set the issue type of the new issue.
.RS
.PP
If this option is not specified, then the issue type of the new issue
will be set as follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
if the previous issue is not an official issue (in-work 00), the issue
type of the new issue will be the same as the previous issue.
.IP \[bu] 2
if the previous issue is an official issue, the issue type of the new
issue will default to \[dq]status\[dq].
.RE
.TP
-\[ha], --remove-deleted
Remove elements with change type of \[dq]delete\[dq].
These elements are automatically removed along with all change marks and
RFUs when an object is upissued from official to the next inwork issue.
This option will remove them when upissuing between inwork issues, or
when making the object official.
.TP
--version
Show version information.
.TP
<file>...
Any number of CSDB objects or other files to upissue.
If none are specified, the object will be read from stdin and the
upissued object will be written to stdout.
.PP
In addition, the following options allow configuration of the XML
parser:
.TP
--dtdload
Load the external DTD.
.TP
--huge
Remove any internal arbitrary parser limits.
.TP
--net
Allow network access to load external DTD and entities.
.TP
--noent
Resolve entities.
.TP
--parser-errors
Emit errors from parser.
.TP
--parser-warnings
Emit warnings from parser.
.TP
--xinclude
Do XInclude processing.
.TP
--xml-catalog <file>
Use an XML catalog when resolving entities.
Multiple catalogs may be loaded by specifying this option multiple
times.
