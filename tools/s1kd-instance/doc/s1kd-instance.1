s1kd\-instance \- Create instances of S1000D CSDB objects
.SH SYNOPSIS

\f[C]
s1kd\-instance\ [options]\ [<object>...]
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]s1kd\-instance\f[] tool produces "instances" of S1000D CSDB
objects, derived from "master" (or "source") objects.
The tool supports multiple methods of instantiating objects:
.IP \[bu] 2
Filtering on user\-supplied applicability definitions, so that
non\-applicable elements and (optionally) unused applicability
annotations are removed in the instance.
The definitions can be supplied directly or read from a Product
Cross\-reference Table (PCT).
.IP \[bu] 2
Filtering on skill levels and security classifications to remove
sensitive data.
.IP \[bu] 2
Using a Common Information Repository (CIR) to produce a standalone
instance from a CIR\-dependent master.
.PP
Any combination of these methods can be used when producing an instance.
.PP
The applications for this tool include:
.IP \[bu] 2
Delivering customized data modules or publications to different
customers.
.IP \[bu] 2
Creating customized instances of CSDB objects which are maintained
within the CSDB.
.IP \[bu] 2
As a backend to filter content or resolve CIR dependencies at runtime in
an electronic viewer application.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A, \-\-simplify
Simplify inline applicability annotations and remove unused ones.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-remove\-unused
Remove unused inline applicability annotations.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-comment <comment>
Add an XML comment to an instance.
Useful as another way of identifying an object as an instance aside from
the source address or extended code, or giving additional information
about a particular instance.
By default, the comment is inserted at the top of the document, but this
can be customized with the \-X option.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-code <code>
Specify a new data module code (DMC) or publication module code (PMC)
for the instance.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-dump <CIR>
Dumps the built\-in XSLT used to resolve dependencies for <CIR> CIR type
to stdout.
This can be used as a starting point for a custom XSLT script to be
specified with the \-x option.
.RS
.PP
The following types currently have built\-in XSLT and can therefore be
used as values for <CIR>:
.IP \[bu] 2

.IP \[bu] 2
zoneRepository
.RE
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-dir <dir>
Directory to start searching for referenced objects in.
By default, the current directory will be searched.
This applies for the ACT and PCT data modules when a product is
specified (\-p) without specifying the PCT explicitly (\-P), or when
searching for source objects (\-\@).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-E, \-\-no\-extension
Remove the extension from an instance produced from an already extended
object.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-extension <ext>
Specify an extension on the data module code (DME) or publication module
code (PME) for the instance.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-F, \-\-flatten\-alts
After filtering, "alts" elements containing only one child element will
be "flattened" by replacing them with the applicable child element.
Alts elements with multiple child elements are left untouched.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-overwrite
Force overwriting of files.
.RS
.PP
By itself, this will cause the source object(s) to be overwritten
instead of being printed to stdout.
.PP
When used with the \-o or \-O options, if a file exists with the same
name as the one specified (\-o) or automatically generated by the tool
(\-O), this will force it to be overwritten.
Otherwise, a warning will be printed and the existing file will not be
overwritten.
.RE
.TP
.B \-G, \-\-custom\-orig <CODE>/<NAME>
Similar to the \-g option, but instead of the default enterprise code
and name, use the values <CODE> and <NAME>, which are separated by a
slash (/).
To only include a code, specify <CODE> with no slash.
To only include a name, specify <NAME> prefixed by a slash.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-set\-orig
Set the originator of the instance.
When this option is specified, the code "\f[C]S1KDI\f[]" and the name
"\f[C]s1kd\-instance\ tool\f[]" are used by default to identify that the
instance was produced by this tool.
A different code and name can be specified with the \-G option.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-h, \-?, \-\-help
Show help/usage message.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-I, \-\-date <date>
Set the issue date of the instance.
By default, the issue date is taken from the source.
If \- is given for <date>, the current date will be used.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-infoname <infoName>
Give the data module instance a different infoName.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-J, \-\-clean\-display\-text
Remove display text from annotations which are simplified in \-A mode.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-j, \-\-clean\-ents
After filtering, remove external entities (such as ICNs) which are no
longer used from the resulting instances.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-K, \-\-skill\-levels <levels>
Filter the object on the specified skill levels.
Elements which are marked with skill levels not contained in the string
<levels> are removed in the resulting instance.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-skill <level>
Set the skill level of the instance.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-list
Source is a list of object filenames to create instances of, rather than
an object itself.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-language <lang>
Set the language and country of the instance.
For example, to create an instance for US English, lang would be
"en\-US".
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-remarks <remarks>
Set the remarks for the instance.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-omit\-issue
Omit issue/inwork numbers from automatically generated filenames.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-issue <iss>
Set the issue and inwork numbers of the instance.
By default, the issue and inwork number are taken from the source.
.RS
.PP
When updating an instance (\-\@), if + is given for <iss>, the updated
instance will have the same issue number with an inwork number
incremented by one.
.RE
.TP
.B \-O, \-\-outdir <dir>
Output instance(s) in <dir>, automatically naming them based on:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
the extension specified with \-e
.IP \[bu] 2
the code specified with \-c
.IP \[bu] 2
The issue info specified with \-n
.IP \[bu] 2
the language and country specified with \-L
.PP
If any of the above are not specified, the information is copied from
the source object.
.PP
If <dir> does not exist, it will be created.
.PP
If a file exists with the same name in the specified directory, a
warning will be display and the file will not be overwritten, unless the
\-f option is specified.
.PP
When using this option, non\-XML files, such as external publications,
may be specified as objects.
They will be copied to <dir>.
.RE
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-out <file>
Output instance to file instead of stdout.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-P, \-\-pct <PCT>
PCT file to read product definitions from (\-p).
If a product is specified but no PCT is given, the tool will attempt to
use the ACT reference of each source data module to find the ACT and PCT
data modules in the current directory.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-product <product>
The ID or primary key of a product in the specified PCT data module
(\-P), the PCT referenced by the ACT data module specified with \-1, or
the PCT data module referenced by the source data module itself.
A primary key is given in the same form as the \-s option and should
match a unique assign of a product instance, e.g.,
"\f[C]serialno:prodattr=12345\f[]".
Multiple keys can be used by specifying this option multiple times.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-cir <CIR> ...
Use a CIR to resolve external dependencies in the master object, making
the instance object standalone.
Additional CIRs can be used by specifying the \-R option multiple times.
.RS
.PP
The following CIRs have some built\-in support:
.IP \[bu] 2
Access points
.IP \[bu] 2
Applicability
.IP \[bu] 2
Cautions
.IP \[bu] 2
Circuit breakers
.IP \[bu] 2
Controls/indicators
.IP \[bu] 2

Illustrated parts data
.IP \[bu] 2
Parts
.IP \[bu] 2
Supplies
.IP \[bu] 2
Tools
.IP \[bu] 2
Warnings
.IP \[bu] 2
Zones
.PP
The methods of resolving the dependencies for a CIR can be changed by
specifying a custom XSLT script with the \-x option.
The built\-in XSLT used for the above CIR data modules can be dumped
with the \-D option.
.RE
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-recursive
Search for referenced objects recursively.
This applies for the ACT and PCT data modules when a product is
specified (\-p) without specifying the PCT explicitly (\-P), or when
searching for source objects (\-\@).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-no\-source\-ident
Do not include <sourceDmIdent>/<sourcePmIdent>/<repositorySourceDmIdent>
in the instance.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-assign <applic>
An applicability definition in the form of
"\f[C]<ident>:<type>=<value>\f[]".
Any number of values can be defined by specifying this option multiple
times.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-tag
Tag non\-applicable elements with the processing instruction
<?notApplicable?> instead of removing them.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-techname <techName>
Give the instance a different techName/pmTitle.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-U, \-\-security\-classes <classes>

Elements marked with security classes not contained in the string
<classes> are removed in the resulting instance.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-security <sec>
Set the security classification of the instance.
An instance may have a lower security classification than the source if
classified information is removed for a particular customer.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
When \-O is used, print the automatically generated file name of the
instance.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-W, \-\-set\-applic
Set the applicability for the whole object, overwriting the current
applicability with the user\-defined applicability values.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-whole\-objects
Check the applicability, skill level, and security classification of the
whole object against the user\-defined applicability, skill levels, and
security classifications.
If the whole object is not applicable, then no instance is created.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-X, \-\-comment\-xpath <path>
The XPath expression indicating where the comment specified with \-C
will be inserted.
This should be the path to an element where the comment will be inserted
as the first child node.
By default, this is the top of the document.

.SS Identifying the source of an instance
.PP
The resulting data module instances will contain the element
\f[C]<sourceDmIdent>\f[], which will contain the identification elements
of the source data modules used to instantiate them.
Publication module instances will contain the element
\f[C]<sourcePmIdent>\f[] instead.
.PP
Additionally, the data module instance will contain an element
\f[C]<repositorySourceDmIdent>\f[] for each CIR specified with the \-R
option.
.PP
If the \-S option is used, neither the
\f[C]<sourceDmIdent>\f[]/\f[C]<sourcePmIdent>\f[] elements or
\f[C]<repositorySourceDmIdent>\f[] elements are added.
This can be useful when this tool is not used to make an "instance" per
se, but more generally to make a module based on an existing module.
.SS Removing/simplifying applicability annotations (\-a vs \-A)
.PP
By default, filtering on applicability will remove invalid elements from
the resulting instance.
In some cases, though, it may be desirable to remove redundant
applicability annotations on valid elements.
The \-a and \-A options provide two methods of doing this.
.PP
The \-a option will remove applicability annotations (applicRefId) from
elements which are deemed to be unambiguously valid (their validity does
not rely on applicability values left undefined by the user).
Unused occurrences of the corresponding applic elements are removed as
well.
.PP
The \-A option will do the same as the \-a option, but will also attempt
to simplify unused parts of applicability annotations.
It simplifies an annotation by removing \f[C]<assert>\f[] elements
determined to be either unambiguously valid or invalid given the
user\-defined values, and removing unneeded \f[C]<evaluate>\f[] elements
when they contain only one remaining \f[C]<assert>\f[].
.PP
For example, given the following input:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

If this data is filtered for version A, without specifying a value for

.PP
The second paragraph is removed, because it only applies to version B.
.PP
If the \-a option is used, the following would be the result:

</para>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The applicability annotation reference for the first paragraph is
removed because, given that the version is A, it must be true.
The corresponding applicability annotations, which are no longer
referenced, are also removed.
The applicability on the third paragraph remains, however, because it is
only true if the version is A \f[I]and\f[] the weather is normal, and no
value has been given for the weather.
.PP
If the \-A option is used, the following would be the result:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<referencedApplicGroup>
<applic\ id="app\-0003">
<assert

</para>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The annotation is now simplified to remove resolved assertions.
Because the version must be A, any assertions restating this can be
removed as redundant, and any portions of the annotation in which the
version is \f[I]not\f[] A can be removed as invalid.
This leaves only the assertion about the weather.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]
.PP
The \-A option may change the \f[I]meaning\f[] of certain applicability
annotations without changing the \f[I]display text\f[].
Display text is always left untouched, so using this option may cause
display text to be technically incorrect.
.PP
This option is best used when display text will be automatically
generated after filtering, such as with the s1kd\-aspp tool.
The \-J option of this tool can be combined with the \-k option of the
s1kd\-aspp tool to only generate display text for annotations which are
modified.
.RE
.SS Applicability of an instance (\-W, \-Y, \-y)
.PP
The applicability of an instance may change as a result of filtering.
For example, a source data module which is applicable to two versions of
a product may produce two instances which are each only applicable to
one version.
There are three options which control how the applicability of the whole
instance object is updated.
.PP
The \-W option will create an applicability annotation for the instance
using only the user\-defined applicability values.
This means, for example, that given the following command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ s1kd\-instance\ \-s\ version:prodattr=A\ \-W\ ...
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The instance would contain the following annotation:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<dmStatus>
<!\-\-\ snip\ \-\->
<applic>
<assert\ applicPropertyIdent="version"
applicPropertyType="prodattr"\ applicPropertyValues="A"/>
</applic>
<!\-\-\ snip\ \-\->
</dmStatus>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
regardless of what the applicability of the source object was.
.PP
The \-y option will create an applicability annotation for the instance
by combining the user\-defined applicability with the applicability of
the source object.
For example, given the following annotation in the source object:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<dmStatus>
<!\-\-\ snip\ \-\->
<applic>
<assert\ applicPropertyIdent="version"
applicPropertyType="prodattr"\ applicPropertyValues="A"/>
</applic>
<!\-\-\ snip\ \-\->
</dmStatus>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and the following command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ s1kd\-instance\ \-s\ weather:condition=icy\ \-y\ ...
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The annotation for the instance would be as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<dmStatus>
<!\-\-\ snip\ \-\->
<applic>
<evaluate\ andOr="and">
<assert\ applicPropertyIdent="version"
applicPropertyType="prodattr"\ applicPropertyValues="A"/>
<assert\ applicPropertyIdent="weather"
applicPropertyType="condition"\ applicPropertyValues="icy"/>
</evaluate>
</applic>
<!\-\-\ snip\ \-\->
</dmStatus>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \-Y option by itself works the same as the \-y option, but allows
custom display text to be set for the annotation.
It can also be combined with the \-W option to add custom display text
to the overwriting annotation:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ s1kd\-instance\ \-s\ version:prodattr=A\ \-WY\ "Version\ A"\ ...
\f[]
.fi
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<dmStatus>
<!\-\-\ snip\ \-\->
<applic>
<displayText>
<simplePara>Version\ A</simplePara>
</displayText>
<assert\ applicPropertyIdent="version"
applicPropertyType="prodattr"\ applicPropertyValues="A"/>
</applic>
<!\-\-\ snip\ \-\->
</dmStatus>
\f[]
.fi
.SS Filtering for multiple values of a single property
.PP
Though not usually the case, it is possible to create an instance which
is filtered on multiple values of the same applicabilty property.
Given the following:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<referencedApplicGroup>
<applic\ id="apA">
<assert\ applicPropertyIdent="attr"
applicPropertyType="prodattr"
applicPropertyValues="A"/>
</applic>
<applic\ id="apB">
<assert\ applicPropertyIdent="attr"
applicPropertyType="prodattr"
applicPropertyValues="B"/>
</applic>
<applic\ id="apC">
<assert\ applicPropertyIdent="attr"
applicPropertyType="prodattr"
applicPropertyValues="C"/>
</applic>
</referencedApplicGroup>
<!\-\-\ ...\ \-\->
<para\ applicRefId="apA">Applies\ to\ A</para>
<para\ applicRefId="apB">Applies\ to\ B</para>
<para\ applicRefId="apC">Applies\ to\ C</para>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
filtering can be applied such that the instance will be applicable to
both A and C, but not B.
This is done by specifying a property multiple times in the
applicability definition arguments.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ s1kd\-instance\ \-A\ \-Y\ "A\ or\ C"\ \-s\ attr:prodattr=A\ \-s\ attr:prodattr=C\ ...
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This would produce the following in the instance:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<dmStatus>
<!\-\-\ ...\ \-\->
<applic>
<displayText>
<simplePara>A\ or\ C</simplePara>
</displayText>
<evaluate\ andOr="or">
<assert\ applicPropertyIdent="attr"
applicPropertyType="prodattr"
applicPropertyValues="A"/>
<assert\ applicPropertyIdent="attr"
applicPropertyType="prodattr"
applicPropertyValues="C"/>

.SS Resolving CIR dependencies with a custom XSLT script (\-x)
.PP
A CIR contains more information about an item than can be captured in a
data module\[aq]s reference to it.
If this additional information is required, there are two methods to
include it:
.IP \[bu] 2
Distribute the CIR with the data module so the extra information can be
linked to
.IP \[bu] 2
"Flatten" the information to fit in the data module\[aq]s schema.
.PP
A custom XSLT script can be supplied with the \-x option, which is then
used to resolve the CIR dependencies of the last CIR specified with \-R.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<xsl:stylesheet
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
version="1.0">
<xsl:template\ match="functionalItemRef">
<xsl:variable\ name="fin"\ select"\@functionalItemNumber"/>
<xsl:variable\ name="spec"\ select="//functionalItemSpec[
functionalItemIdent/\@functionalItemNumber\ =\ $fin]"/>
<xsl:value\-of\ select="$spec/name"/>
</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This script would resolve a \f[C]functionalItemRef\f[] by "flattening"
it to the value of the \f[C]name\f[] element obtained from the CIR.
.PP
The example CIR would contain a specification like:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<functionalItemSpec>
<functionalItemIdent\ functionalItemNumber="ABC"
functionalItemType="fit01"/>
<name>Hydraulic\ pump</name>
<functionalItemAlts>
<functionalItem/>
</functionalItemAlts>
</functionalItemSpec>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The source data module would contain a reference:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<para>
The
<functionalItemRef\ functionalItemNumber="ABC"/>
is\ an\ item\ in\ the\ system.
</para>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The command would resemble:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ s1kd\-instance\ \-R\ <CIR>\ \-x\ <custom\ XSLT>\ <src>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
And the resulting XML would be:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<para>The\ Hydraulic\ pump\ is\ an\ item\ in\ the\ system.</para>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The source data module and CIR are combined in to a single XML document
which is used as the input to the XSLT script.
The root element \f[C]mux\f[] contains two \f[C]dmodule\f[] elements.
The first is the source data module, and the second is the CIR data
module specified with the corresponding \-R option.
The CIR data module is first filtered on the defined applicability.
.PP
An "identity" template is automatically inserted in to the custom XSLT
script, equivalent to the following:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<xsl:template\ match="\@*|node()">
<xsl:copy>
<xsl:apply\-templates\ select="\@*|node()"/>
</xsl:copy>
</xsl:template>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This means any elements or attributes which are not matched with a more
specific template in the custom XSLT script are automatically copied.
.PP
The set of built\-in XSLT scripts used to resolve dependencies can be
dumped using the \-D option.
.SS Updating instances (\-\@)
.PP
The \-\@ option is used to automatically update instance objects from
their source objects.
.PP
The tool will use the \f[C]<sourceDmIdent>\f[]/\f[C]<sourcePmIdent>\f[]
in each instance to find the source object they were derived from, and
filter it based on the instance\[aq]s metadata in order to produce an
updated version of the instance.
CIRs identified by \f[C]<repositorySourceDmIdent>\f[] elements in the
instance will also be used to update it.
.PP
Only objects which identify a source object will be processed in this
mode.
All other non\-instance objects specified are ignored.
The elements \f[C]<sourceDmIdent>\f[], \f[C]<sourcePmIdent>\f[] and
\f[C]<repositorySourceDmIdent>\f[] identify a specific issue of an
object that the instance was last updated from, but this is ignored and
the latest issue found of a source object will be used instead.
.PP
This feature is primarily useful when instances of objects are stored in
the CSDB, rather than only being generated during publication or
dynamically in a viewer.
For example, imagine you have a descriptive data module:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
DMC\-EX\-A\-00\-00\-00\-00A\-040A\-D_001\-00_EN\-CA.XML
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and you deliver to two customers, C1 and C2.
The data module contains information for both:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<description>
<para>This\ text\ applies\ to\ all\ customers.</para>
<para\ applicRefId="app\-C1">This\ only\ applies\ to\ Customer\ 1.</para>
<para\ applicRefId="app\-C2">This\ only\ applies\ to\ Customer\ 2.</para>
</description>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Neither customer wants to see information that applies only to the
other, so you can create two customized instances of this data module,
identified with the extended code:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
DMC\-EX\-A\-00\-00\-00\-00A\-040A\-D_001\-00_EN\-CA.XML
DME\-12345\-C1\-EX\-A\-00\-00\-00\-00A\-040A\-D_001\-00_EN\-CA.XML
DME\-12345\-C2\-EX\-A\-00\-00\-00\-00A\-040A\-D_001\-00_EN\-CA.XML
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Each instance data module identifies the original data module as its
source:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<sourceDmIdent>
<dmCode\ modelIdentCode="EX"\ systemDiffCode="A"\ systemCode="00"
subSystemCode="0"\ subSubSystemCode="0"\ assyCode="00"\ disassyCode="00"
disassyCodeVariant="A"\ infoCode="040"\ infoCodeVariant="A"
itemLocationCode="D"/>
<language\ languageIsoCode="en"\ countryIsoCode="CA"/>
<issueInfo\ issueNumber="001"\ inWork="00"/>
</sourceDmIdent>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and is set to apply only to the correct customer:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<dmStatus>
\&...
<applic>
<assert\ applicPropertyIdent="customer"\ applicPropertyType="prodattr"
applicPropertyValues="1"/>
</applic>
\&...
</dmStatus>
\f[]
.fi
.RS

\f[B]Note\f[]

The assertions in the applicability of an instance must use single
values in order to work in this mode.
