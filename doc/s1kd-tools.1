s1kd\-tools \- Tools for S1000D data
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS S1000D
.PP
\f[B]S1000D\f[] is "an international specification for the procurement
and production of technical publications", part of the S\-Series of ILS
specifications.
The main focus of S1000D is the breakdown and classification of
documents in to individual components, called "data modules", which can
be re\-used in multiple publications.
These data modules are typically authored using a set of provided XML
schemas, allowing them to be automatically managed in a Common Source
Database (CSDB) and validated against a defined set of project "business
rules".
.SS s1kd\-tools
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-tools\f[] are a set of small tools for creating and
manipulating S1000D data.
They are designed to be used as a standalone method of maintaining a
simple S1000D CSDB, in conjunction with a more typical version control
system such as Git or SVN, as a backend to implement a more complex
S1000D CSDB, or to support an existing S1000D CSDB already in use by a
project.
.SS CSDB
.PP
Common Source Databases can be implemented in any number of ways.
For the purposes of the s1kd\-tools, the CSDB is simply a directory
within a filesystem.
Use of the "File\-based transfer" file naming conventions in Chap 7 of
the S1000D specification are recommended, and most of the tools will use
these conventions when creating or listing CSDB objects represented by
files.
In order to use these tools in conjuction with other implementations of
CSDBs, a project can make use of "transfer packages" also described in
Chap 7 to facilitate interchange between the two kinds of CSDB.
.SS Relationship to the S1000D process
.PP
The s1kd\-tools can support multiple parts of the basic S1000D process:
.IP "1." 3
\f[B]Generation:\f[] The generation of new CSDB objects is supported by
the \f[B]s1kd\-dmrl\f[] tool and the \f[B]s1kd\-new*\f[] set of tools.
These provide two methods of creating objects, either using a data
management requirements list (DMRL) or a more on\-the\-fly approach
using the s1kd\-new* tools directly.
.RS 4
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-defaults\f[] tool is used to manage the files which
contain default metadata for new CSDB objects.
.RE
.IP "2." 3
\f[B]Authoring:\f[] These tools support the authoring process.
.RS 4
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-addicn\f[] tool creates the notation and entity elements
to reference an ICN in a data module.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-ls\f[] tool lists data modules within a directory.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-metadata\f[] tool lists and edits S1000D metadata on CSDB
objects.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-mvref\f[] tool changes references to one object into
references to another.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-ref\f[] tool can be used to quickly insert references to
other CSDB objects.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-sns\f[] tool can be used to organize the CSDB using a
given SNS structure.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-upissue\f[] tool moves CSDB objects through the standard
S1000D workflow, between "inwork" (draft) and "official" states.
.RE
.IP "3." 3
\f[B]Validation:\f[] These tools all validate different aspects of CSDB
objects.
.RS 4
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-appcheck\f[] tool validates the applicability of CSDB
objects.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-brexcheck\f[] tool validates CSDB objects against a
business rules exchange (BREX) data module, which contains the
project\-defined computable business rules.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-refs\f[] tool lists references in a CSDB object to
generate a list of dependencies on other CSDB objects.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-repcheck\f[] tool validates CIR references in CSDB
objects.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-validate\f[] tool validates CSDB objects according to
their S1000D schema and general correctness as XML documents.
.RE
.IP "4." 3
\f[B]Publication:\f[] These tools support the production of publications
from a CSDB.
.RS 4
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-acronyms\f[] tool can automatically mark up acronyms
within data modules, and can also generate lists of acronyms marked up
within data modules.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-aspp\f[] tool preprocesses applicability statements in a
data module, generating display text and "presentation" applicability
statements.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-flatten\f[] tool flattens a publication module and
referenced data modules in to a single "deliverable" file for a
publishing system.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-fmgen\f[] tool generates front matter data module content
from a publication module.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-icncatalog\f[] tool resolves ICN references in objects.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-index\f[] tool flags index keywords in a data module
based on a user\-defined list.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-instance\f[] tool produces "instances" of CSDB objects
using applicability filtering and/or common information repositories
(CIRs).
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-neutralize\f[] tool generates IETP neutral metadata for
CSDB objects.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-syncrefs\f[] tool generates the References table within
data modules.
.PP
The \f[B]s1kd\-uom\f[] tool converts units of measure used in data
modules.
