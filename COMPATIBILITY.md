# General

This document summarizes the compatibility between the s1kd-tools and
each issue of the S1000D specification for which support is planned.

  - \[empty\]  
    Support is planned but not yet implemented.

  - X  
    Support is implemented.

  - /  
    Support is partially implemented.

  - \~  
    Support is not planned. Usually this is because older issues of the
    specification did not cover the function of the tool.

> **Note**
> 
> Although a tool may not directly support an issue of S1000D, it may
> still be possible to use with that issue.
> 
> For example, the s1kd-brexcheck tool is said not to support Issue 2.0
> or Issue 2.1, because the BREX data module schema was not introduced
> until Issue 2.2. However, an Issue 2.2 or greater BREX data module can
> still be used to check Issue 2.0 or Issue 2.1 CSDB objects.
